# Using Skill Factory

## Quick Start

Hey Claude! I just added the 'skill-factory' skill. Can you show me what it can do?

## Create a Simple Skill

I need a skill for analyzing CSV data files. Create it for me and package it ready for deployment.

## Create a Domain-Specific Skill

I work in financial services. Create a skill for analyzing quarterly sales reports and identifying trends. Make it professional and ready to use.

## Create Multiple Skills

Generate 3 skills for my marketing team:
1. Social media content planning from briefs
2. Email campaign performance analysis
3. Competitor content gap analysis

Package them all as separate ZIPs.

## Examples That Work Great

**Basic usage:**
"Hey Claude, create a skill for converting meeting notes into action items. Keep it simple."
