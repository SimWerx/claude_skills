## When to use this skill

Use this skill to synthesize research from multiple articles, industry reports, technical documentation, market research, or any scenario requiring source attribution and evidence-based synthesis.

## How to use this skill

1. **Identify the synthesis type** - Standard summary or comparative analysis
2. **Load the appropriate template** from `references/formats.md`
3. **Apply core principles** - Source attribution, evidence hierarchy, answer-first
4. **Structure output** using the loaded template

## Core principles

1. **Source attribution** - Every claim cites source with date: [Source Name, Date]
2. **Evidence hierarchy** - Distinguish verified facts, reported claims, and assumptions
3. **Answer-first** - Lead with most important finding
4. **Synthesis not summary** - Connect insights, identify patterns, note contradictions
5. **Flag assumptions** - Explicitly label inferences as assumptions

## Output templates

See [references/formats.md](references/formats.md) for:
- Standard executive summary format
- Comparative analysis format

## When sources conflict

Present both perspectives with attribution rather than choosing one.
