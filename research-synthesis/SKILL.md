name: research-synthesis
description: Transform research materials and multiple sources into executive summaries with proper citations, evidence hierarchy, and actionable insights. Claude should use this skill when synthesizing research articles, reports, or multiple information sources into decision-ready summaries.
---

## When to use this skill

Use this skill to synthesize research from:
- Multiple articles or papers
- Industry reports and analyst commentary
- Technical documentation across sources
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Any scenario requiring source attribution and evidence-based synthesis

## Output structure

### Standard format

```markdown
# [Topic] - Research Synthesis

## Key Finding
[Most important insight in 1-2 sentences]

## Supporting Evidence
- **Point 1**: [Evidence] [Source, Date]
- **Point 2**: [Evidence] [Source, Date]
- **Point 3**: [Evidence] [Source, Date]

## Cross-Source Insights
[Patterns, contradictions, or consensus across sources]

## Assumptions
[Explicitly state inferences not directly supported]

## Sources
1. [Source - Full citation with date]
2. [Source - Full citation with date]
```

## Key principles

1. **Source attribution** - Every claim cites source with date: [Source Name, Date]
2. **Evidence hierarchy** - Distinguish verified facts, reported claims, and assumptions
3. **Answer-first** - Lead with most important finding
4. **Synthesis not summary** - Connect insights, identify patterns, note contradictions
5. **Flag assumptions** - Explicitly label inferences as assumptions

## When sources conflict

Present both perspectives with attribution rather than choosing one.
