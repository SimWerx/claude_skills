code: A-FCT1
parent_rubric: A-FCT
label: Vitals Extraction Incorrect

concept: >
  One or more core vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO2, EtCO2, temperature) or clinical measurements
  (pain scale, blood glucose) are extracted incorrectly into Medic Copilot's structured output
  compared to the values present in the ASR/narrative or ground truth.

weight: 0.40
threshold: 0.90
criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All vitals extracted correctly"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ correct)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% correct)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - vitals systematically incorrect"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative or ground truth clearly contains a vital or clinical measurement
  such as pain scale or blood glucose. Flag if the structured output omits it, assigns a
  different numeric value, or confuses units such that the recorded vital is clinically
  different from what was spoken.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for minor rounding differences that do not change interpretation (e.g., 97 vs 98),
  or when the narrative itself is ambiguous or missing the vital.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'blood pressure one fifty four over ninety two' but `draatt_json` records 115/92."
  - "EtCO2 of 42 mmHg in the narrative but output leaves EtCO2 field empty."
  - "Pain scale 8/10 in narrative but output leaves pain_score field empty."
  - "Blood glucose 342 mg/dL in narrative but glucose not extracted to structured output."
