code: A-TMP1
parent_rubric: A-TMP
label: Temporal Ordering Incorrect

concept: >
  The sequence of key events in Medic Copilot's output (onset, arrival, interventions,
  reassessments, transport) does not match the ordering implied by the ASR narrative or
  ground truth.

weight: 0.20
threshold: 0.85
criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All events in correct chronological order"
    0.85: "Excellent (85%+ pairs correct)"
    0.70: "Good (70-85% pairs correct)"
    0.60: "Fair (60-70% pairs correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - systematic ordering errors"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the scenario contains time-sensitive steps with clear sequencing requirements.
  Flag if interventions are placed before prerequisites (e.g., nitroglycerin before first BP
  or 12-lead confirmation of STEMI), transport is documented before any on-scene assessment,
  or other clearly time-sensitive steps are rearranged relative to the case description.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when the relative ordering is preserved but timestamps are approximate, or when
  ordering is genuinely ambiguous in the source material.

examples:
  - "Output timeline shows transport departure before any documented vitals or exam despite a detailed on-scene assessment in the narrative."
  - "RSI documented as intubation first, then sedative and paralytic."
  - "Protocol ordering: STEMI workflow shows nitroglycerin given before 12-lead confirmation of ST elevation - NTG requires ECG verification first."
  - "Protocol ordering: Stroke timeline shows tPA discussion before LKW documented - eligibility determination requires LKW first."
  - "Protocol ordering: Cardiac arrest shows epinephrine before initial rhythm identification - drug selection depends on rhythm."
