# Benchmark: A-CMP2 — Response Section Incomplete
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)

code: A-CMP2
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Response Section Incomplete

concept: >
  Medic Copilot's output fails to include key Response section details (unit response and crew
  information) that were present in the narrative. This covers missing response mode (e.g.,
  emergent vs non-emergent), crew identifiers, or notable delays/hazards en route.

    1.0: "All response section fields present"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ fields present)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% fields present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - response section incomplete"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative clearly describes response details (dispatch mode, units responding,
  crew names, any response delays or scene hazards). Flag if the structured output's response
  section omits one or more of these elements, for example if the transcript states "Medic 5
  responded code 3 with two paramedics, no delays" and draatt_json lacks the response mode or
  crew info.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply if the scenario template intentionally omits a separate response section (e.g.,
  certain overlays or abbreviated templates). Also exclude cases where the narrative itself
  provides no response details - no penalty for absence of information not dictated.

examples:
  - "Dispatched emergent, Medic 42 and Engine 15 responding, no traffic delays - but the output does not list the responding units or indicates an incorrect mode."
  - "Narrative describes a scene hazard ('downed power lines on approach delayed arrival by 5 minutes') not captured in the output's response section."
