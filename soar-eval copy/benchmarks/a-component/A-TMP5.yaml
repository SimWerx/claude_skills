# Benchmark: A-TMP5 — Trend Direction Misinterpreted
# Parent Rubric: A-TMP (Temporal Ordering)
# Note: Migrated from A-TMP4 to make room for Explicit Timing Consistency

code: A-TMP5
parent_rubric: A-TMP
label: Trend Direction Misinterpreted

concept: >
  Medic Copilot misrepresents the overall trend of the patient's condition. Despite correct
  ordering of events, the output's description of improvement vs. deterioration is opposite
  to what the narrative data indicates (or the output fails to note a significant trend).

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All patient trends correctly interpreted"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ trends correct)"
    0.85: "Good (85-90% trends correct)"
    0.75: "Fair (75-85% trends correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - trend direction errors present"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when multiple data points over time clearly show the patient improving or worsening.
  Flag if the output misrepresents the trend direction, implies stability when vitals show
  decline, fails to reflect improvement after intervention, or ignores a documented trend
  altogether.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for single pre/post comparisons already covered by A-TMP2 (that benchmark handles
  discrete paired trend errors). Also exclude cases where changes are minimal or ambiguous
  such that a trend is not clinically apparent (e.g., vitals fluctuate within normal range
  without a clear direction).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'BP 90/50 -> 70/40, HR 120 -> 140, patient increasingly pale and lethargic'. Output summary says 'patient remained hemodynamically stable' or fails to mention the deterioration. The AI incorrectly portrays a worsening shock trend as stability."
  - "Narrative: 'Pain 9/10 down to 5/10 after morphine, patient less distressed'. Output does not indicate any improvement (or worse, labels pain as 'worsened'), missing the positive trend in patient response."
