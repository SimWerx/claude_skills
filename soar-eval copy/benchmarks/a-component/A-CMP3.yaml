# Benchmark: A-CMP3 — Arrival Section Incomplete
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)

code: A-CMP3
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Arrival Section Incomplete

concept: >
  Medic Copilot's output omits critical Arrival details that the narrative provides, such as
  patient position/location on arrival, scene context, or arrival time. This benchmark catches
  missing content in the arrival section of DRAATT.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All arrival section fields present"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ fields present)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% fields present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - arrival section incomplete"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes how the patient was found and initial scene observations
  (e.g., "arrived at 08:46 to find patient lying on the bedroom floor, scene secure with police
  on scene"). Flag if the output's arrival documentation lacks one or more of those details
  (arrival timestamp, patient location/position, scene safety findings, immediate patient presentation).

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when the scenario has no on-scene component (e.g., interfacility transfers where an
  arrival narrative is not expected). Also exclude cases where the template legitimately merges
  arrival info into another section or the narrative itself is missing these details.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Arrived on scene at 14:30, found patient seated in a recliner complaining of chest pain, scene calm.' Output: no mention of patient's found position or the scene environment in the arrival section."
  - "Narrative notes 'patient found unresponsive on bathroom floor, agonal respirations' but the output arrival section fails to mention patient's initial condition or location."
