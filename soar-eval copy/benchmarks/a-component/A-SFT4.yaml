label: Missing Repeat Vitals After High-Risk Intervention

concept: >
  After a high-risk intervention (nitroglycerin, opioids, sedatives, paralytics, intubation,
  cardioversion, physical restraints), Medic Copilot fails to extract stated reassessment
  vitals or flag missing reassessments that ground truth marks as gaps.

    0.80: "Good (80-90% reassessments present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% reassessments present)"
    0.0: "Failed - reassessments missing after high-risk interventions"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when ground truth marks a test case as having a high-risk intervention with
  missing reassessment. Flag if Medic Copilot fails to extract stated follow-up vitals or
  flag the gap.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when repeat vitals were truly not obtained and that is clearly documented as a
  limitation, or when timelines are approximate but a reasonable reassessment is present.

examples:
  - "Nitroglycerin given for chest pain with only a single initial vitals set documented and no follow-up pain or BP."
  - "RSI medications given with no post-intubation EtCO2 or SpO2 documented anywhere."
  - "Morphine 4mg IV given for pain but no reassessment of pain score or vitals afterward."
  - "Cardioversion performed but no post-procedure rhythm or BP documented."
  - "Physical restraints applied but no documented reassessment of circulation, respiratory status, or patient condition."
