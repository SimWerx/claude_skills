# Benchmark: A-PED2 — Pediatric Assessment Completeness
# Parent Rubric: A-PED (Pediatric Documentation)

code: A-PED2
parent_rubric: A-PED
label: Pediatric Assessment Incomplete

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to include age-appropriate assessment details for
  pediatric patients, such as documented weight, Broselow color/estimated weight,
  or pediatric-specific exam findings (cap refill, fontanelle, developmental
  status) that were stated in the narrative. This benchmark focuses on pediatric
  patients where the child is the patient; newborn APGARs from field deliveries
  are owned by A-OBS1.

weight: 0.40

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All pediatric-specific fields captured"
    0.90: "Excellent - key pediatric data present"
    0.80: "Good - minor pediatric details missing"
    0.0: "Failed - critical pediatric data omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the scenario involves a pediatric patient (child is the patient)
  and the narrative contains age-specific information (weight in kg, Broselow
  color, pediatric vital ranges, developmental status, pediatric-specific exam
  findings). Flag if this information is missing from the structured output.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to adult patients. Do not apply to newborn APGAR scores from
  field deliveries (those are owned by A-OBS1). Do not flag information that
  was not stated in the narrative. Minor formatting differences are acceptable
  if clinical content is preserved.

examples:
  - "Narrative states 'Broselow yellow, estimated 18 kg' but no weight appears in output."
  - "Broselow tape example: 'Used Broselow tape, patient is green zone, approximately 12 kg' - output must capture either green zone or 12 kg weight."
  - "Pediatric seizure: '3-year-old, 14 kg per mom, prolonged cap refill' but output omits weight and cap refill finding."
  - "Infant assessment: 'Fontanelle flat, cap refill 2 seconds, alert and tracking' but output lacks pediatric-specific exam findings."
