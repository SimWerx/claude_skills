# Benchmark: A-CAR2 — CPR/Arrest Event Details Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-CAR (Cardiac Arrest Documentation)

code: A-CAR2
parent_rubric: A-CAR
label: CPR Arrest Event Details Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot omits key resuscitation sequence details from a cardiac arrest
  case, such as initial rhythm, number of shocks, defibrillation times,
  epinephrine/amiodarone administration, or airway management.

  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All arrest details captured"
    0.85: "Good - major details present"
    0.70: "Fair - some details missing"
    0.0: "Failed - arrest summarized without specifics"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes specific resuscitation details (initial
  rhythm, shock count, medication doses, airway placement). Flag if the output
  provides only a vague summary like "CPR performed" without specifics.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when the narrative itself lacks specific details. Minor
  timestamp variations are acceptable if the sequence is correct. Traumatic
  arrest scenarios may have fewer interventions (no defibrillation for PEA/asystole,
  limited medications) and should not false-fail for expected omissions.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'VFib, shocked x3, epi x2, advanced airway placed' but output says only 'Cardiac arrest, CPR performed.'"
  - "Initial rhythm PEA stated but not captured in structured output."
