# Benchmark: A-CMP6 — Transport/Handoff Completeness
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)
# Source: transport-handoff-details-incomplete.yaml

code: A-CMP6
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Transport Handoff Details Incomplete

concept: >
  Transport, delivery, or refusal details (mode, delays/incidents, receiving staff, condition
  on arrival, equipment/belongings disposition) are under-documented in Medic Copilot's output
  relative to what a complete DRAATT Transport/Refusal section should contain.

weight: 0.167
threshold: 0.80
criticality: threshold_gate

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All transport/handoff fields complete"
    0.80: "Good (80%+ fields present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% fields present)"
    0.60: "Poor (60-70% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - transport details missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when a patient is transported or refuses transport. Flag if the output is missing one
  or more of: transport mode, any mention of en-route delays/incidents, receiving staff/role,
  patient condition on arrival, or what happened to key equipment/belongings at handoff.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when all required elements are present but concise, or when the scenario ends
  before transport (e.g., obvious death left on scene) and no transport is expected. Do not
  use for DOA/field pronouncement cases (use A-CMP5). For detailed refusal documentation
  (risks explained, capacity, signature), see A-REF rubric benchmarks.

examples:
  - "Transport narrative lists destination but not who received the patient or what their condition was on arrival."
  - "Refusal record with no documented explanation of risks accepted by the patient."
