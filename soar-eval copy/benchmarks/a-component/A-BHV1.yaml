# Benchmark: A-BHV1 — Restraint/Sedation Not Documented
# Parent Rubric: A-BHV (Behavioral/Psychiatric Documentation)

code: A-BHV1
parent_rubric: A-BHV
label: Restraint or Sedation Not Documented

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to document that restraints were applied or sedatives
  given in a combative patient scenario. Both physical restraints (soft,
  4-point, hard) and chemical sedation are distinct interventions and should
  be captured separately when documented. If the narrative states "patient
  was combative, secured with soft restraints" or "received 5 mg Versed
  for agitation," the output must include this information. When narrative
  includes IMC-RASS scores or documents de-escalation attempts prior to
  restraint/sedation, these details should also be captured.

  descriptions:

    0.95: "Excellent - key intervention captured"
    0.80: "Good - restraint noted but details missing"
    0.0: "Failed - restraint or sedation omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes physical restraints (soft restraints,
  4-point, secured to stretcher) or chemical sedation (Versed, Ativan,
  ketamine, Haldol for agitation). Flag if the output does not document these
  interventions in Treatment, or if post-restraint monitoring documented in
  the narrative (e.g., "restraints checked q15, circulation intact") is not
  captured per CMS requirements. Also flag if IMC-RASS scores or de-escalation
  attempts are stated in the narrative but missing from the output.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-behavioral cases. Do not flag routine stretcher
  straps (standard transport). Only flag when restraints were applied
  specifically for combative behavior or chemical sedation was given.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Patient combative, secured with soft restraints to stretcher' but output has no mention of restraints."
  - "Narrative: 'Versed 5 mg IM for agitation' but output does not include this medication."
  - "Both types: 'Soft restraints applied, Versed 5 mg given' - both physical and chemical interventions must be documented."
  - "Monitoring: 'Restraints checked q15 min, circulation intact' - post-restraint monitoring should be captured if narrated."
  - "RASS score: 'RASS +2, patient threatening staff' - RASS score should be captured when stated."
  - "De-escalation: 'Verbal de-escalation attempted x2 without success, then soft restraints applied' - de-escalation attempts should be captured."
