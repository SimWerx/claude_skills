# Benchmark: A-OBS1 — APGAR/Neonatal Info Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-OBS (Obstetric & Neonatal Documentation)

code: A-OBS1
parent_rubric: A-OBS
label: APGAR or Neonatal Status Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to document newborn status after a field delivery.
  If the narrative provides APGAR scores or describes the newborn's
  condition ("baby boy, crying, APGAR 8 and 9"), the output must include
  this information. Also applies to neonatal resuscitation steps if performed.
  For multiple gestations (twins, triplets), each neonate must be documented
  separately with distinct APGAR scores and status.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "APGAR and neonatal status fully documented"
    0.95: "Excellent - key neonatal data present"
    0.80: "Good - partial neonatal info captured"
    0.0: "Failed - APGAR or neonatal status omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes a field delivery with APGAR scores,
  newborn condition, birth time, or neonatal resuscitation (stimulation,
  oxygen, suctioning). Flag if the output does not capture this information,
  or for twin deliveries if both neonates are not documented with individual
  APGAR scores when provided.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-delivery cases. Do not apply to non-delivery pediatric
  assessments (those are owned by A-PED2). Do not flag if the narrative does
  not mention APGAR or neonatal status. If only APGAR at 1 minute is
  documented (5 min not yet reached), that is acceptable.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Baby delivered, APGAR 8 and 9, crying vigorous' but output has no APGAR or neonatal status."
  - "Narrative: 'Stimulated newborn, dried and warmed, O2 blow-by' but output says only 'delivery occurred.'"
  - "Birth time: 'Baby delivered at 14:32' must include delivery time in output."
  - "Twin delivery: 'Baby A APGAR 8/9, Baby B APGAR 7/8' - both neonates must be captured individually."
  - "Twin with different status: 'First twin vigorous, APGAR 9/9; second twin required stimulation, APGAR 6/8' - output missing second neonate is a failure."
