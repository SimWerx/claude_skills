code: A-CMP5
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: DOA Pronouncement Fields Incomplete

concept: >
  In an obvious-death (DOA) case, Medic Copilot's output omits one or more critical
  pronouncement details (method, physician, time, agency) needed for a complete DOA record.

weight: 0.167
threshold: 1.0
criticality: hard_gate

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All four pronouncement fields complete"
    0.75: "Three of four fields present"
    0.50: "Two of four fields present"
    0.25: "One of four fields present"
    0.0: "Failed - pronouncement fields missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the scenario involves an obvious death and the trace output documents a pronouncement.
  Flag if the output fails to include all of: pronouncement method (standing order vs base call),
  pronouncing physician or authority (physician name for base contact cases, or protocol reference
  for standing order cases), pronouncement time, and pronouncement agency or equivalent wording.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for non-DOA cases, or when all four elements are present but minor wording or
  formatting differences exist without loss of information.

examples:
  - "DOA trace where the narrative says 'pronounced at 06:31 by Dr. Chen' but no agency or 'standing order per protocol' is recorded anywhere."
  - "`draatt_json` has pronouncement_time and physician but leaves pronouncement_method null."
  - "Standing order case: 'Pronounced per standing order 0051' - method is standing order; authority field satisfied by protocol reference (no real-time physician involved)."
  - "DOA nuance: 'Base contact Dr. Adams authorized field termination at 14:22' - method is base order (not standing order), physician is Dr. Adams, time is 14:22."
  - "Field termination with base contact: 'Contacted medical control, Dr. Smith agreed with field pronouncement at 0845, coroner notified' - all four fields present and must be captured."
