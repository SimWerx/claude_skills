# Benchmark: A-FCT3 — Procedure Extraction Accuracy
# Parent Rubric: A-FCT (Fact Extraction)

code: A-FCT3
parent_rubric: A-FCT
label: Procedure Extraction Incorrect

concept: >
  Non-medication procedures explicitly stated in the narrative (IV/IO access, 12-lead
  ECG, oxygen therapy, basic airway maneuvers) are extracted incorrectly or omitted
  from Medic Copilot's structured output compared to ground truth.

weight: 0.15
threshold: 0.85
criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All procedures extracted correctly"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ correct)"
    0.85: "Good (85-90% correct)"
    0.75: "Fair (75-85% correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - procedures systematically incorrect or omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative or ground truth clearly contains a procedure.
  Flag if the structured output omits it entirely, records the wrong procedure type,
  or misidentifies key details (e.g., site, size, device, flow rate).

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for RSI/intubation procedures (covered by A-PRT1), trauma-specific
  interventions like tourniquets or chest seals (covered by A-TRM2), or medication
  administrations (covered by A-FCT2).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'started 18 gauge IV in left AC' but output records no IV access."
  - "Narrative: '12-lead obtained showing ST elevation' but output has no 12-lead documented."
  - "Narrative: 'placed patient on 15L non-rebreather' but output shows nasal cannula at 2L."
  - "Narrative: 'IO placed in right tibia' but output records IV access only."
