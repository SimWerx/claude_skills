# Benchmark: A-EVD3 — Evidence Span Misalignment
# Parent Rubric: A-EVD (Evidence Attribution)

code: A-EVD3
parent_rubric: A-EVD
label: Evidence Span Misalignment

concept: >
  The evidence text linked to an extracted fact does not accurately support the fact, even if
  a span is provided. In these cases, Medic Copilot's cited narrative span is incomplete,
  tangential, or misleading relative to the output claim.

weight: 0.20

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All evidence spans accurately support their facts"
    0.95: "Excellent (95%+ spans aligned)"
    0.90: "Very good (90-95% spans aligned)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% spans aligned)"
    0.0: "Failed - systematic evidence misalignment"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when an output fact or value has an evidence span attached. Flag if that span either
  fails to include the key detail of the fact or includes content that doesn't directly
  substantiate the fact, for example if the output states a medication dose and the cited
  span is a portion of the transcript that lacks the dose value.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply if evidence spans are simply longer than necessary but still contain the
  relevant information (extra context is acceptable). Also exclude cases where the evidence
  is entirely missing or clearly wrong - those are handled by A-EVD1 (unsupported/absent
  evidence).

examples:
  - "Output documents 'Pain score 9/10' but the attached evidence span only shows 'patient reports chest pain' without the numeric severity. The evidence is present but doesn't capture the 9/10 value, failing to fully support the structured data."
  - "Output records 'administered 0.4mg nitroglycerin' and links a span, but the span text corresponds to a different medication or dose (e.g., quotes an aspirin administration) - the span exists but is for the wrong fact."
  - "Contradictory evidence: Output documents 'wheezing: true' but the attached evidence span says 'no wheezing noted, lungs clear bilaterally' - the evidence directly contradicts the extracted fact."
  - "Contradictory evidence: Output records 'chest_pain: present' but linked span reads 'patient denies chest pain' - polarity mismatch between evidence and structured field."
