code: A-EVD1
parent_rubric: A-EVD
label: Evidence Span Unsupported or Missing

concept: >
  Structured facts in Medic Copilot's output either lack any linked narrative evidence span
  or are supported only by spans that do not actually contain or justify the claimed fact.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All facts have valid evidence spans"
    0.80: "Good (80%+ facts have valid evidence)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% facts have evidence)"
    0.60: "Poor (60-70% facts have evidence)"
    0.0: "Failed - evidence spans missing or invalid"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the trace includes an evidence map or similar structure. Flag if one or more key
  extracted facts (vitals, meds, diagnosis, protocol branch) have no evidence span, or the
  mapped text contradicts or fails to mention the fact it supposedly supports.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when evidence spans are present and roughly correct but differ only in length
  (e.g., extra context words), or when the issue is a factual error despite correct evidence
  linkage (use fact-extraction or diagnosis codes instead).

examples:
  - "Impression 'acute inferior STEMI' mapped to a span that only says 'nonspecific ST changes'."
  - "Vitals and medications exist in DRAATT JSON but the evidence map is empty."
  - "ACCEPTABLE: Impression 'STEMI' with evidence span 'ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF' - span directly supports the impression."
  - "UNACCEPTABLE: Impression 'sepsis' with evidence span describing patient's anxiety symptoms - evidence does not support the stated impression."
  - "UNACCEPTABLE: Output documents 'BP 90/60' but the evidence span linked refers to a different patient's vitals or an unrelated section of narrative."
