# Benchmark: A-OBS2 — Pregnancy Details Omitted
# Parent Rubric: A-OBS (Obstetric & Neonatal Documentation)

code: A-OBS2
parent_rubric: A-OBS
label: Pregnancy Details Omitted

concept: >
  Medic Copilot omits critical maternal details in an obstetric case,
  such as gestational age, gravida/para status, multiple gestation, or
  complications like bleeding or hypertension. These details set context
  for OB emergencies and guide treatment decisions.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All pregnancy details documented"
    0.90: "Excellent - key maternal data present"
    0.80: "Good - most pregnancy info captured"
    0.0: "Failed - critical pregnancy details omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains gestational age (weeks), gravida/para
  status, multiple gestation (twins), pregnancy complications (bleeding,
  preeclampsia, premature labor), or post-partum maternal status (estimated
  blood loss, placenta delivery status). Flag if the output does not preserve
  this information.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-OB cases. Do not flag if the narrative does not
  mention these specific details. Approximate gestational age ("third
  trimester" vs "36 weeks") is acceptable if clinically equivalent.

examples:
  - "Narrative: '35 weeks pregnant, G3P2, possible preeclampsia' but output says only 'pregnant patient.'"
  - "Narrative: 'Twin pregnancy at 32 weeks with vaginal bleeding' but output lacks gestational age and twin status."
  - "Post-partum: 'Placenta delivered intact, EBL approximately 500 mL' - maternal status details should be captured."
  - "Placenta status: 'Placenta not yet delivered, cord clamped and cut' - placenta delivery status is critical for post-partum assessment."
  - "EBL documentation: 'Estimated blood loss 800 mL, fundal massage performed' - EBL and hemorrhage interventions must be captured when stated."
  - "Twin pregnancy details: 'Dichorionic diamniotic twins at 34 weeks, Twin A vertex, Twin B breech' - twin-specific positioning and status should be preserved."
