# Benchmark: A-BHV2 — Capacity/Consent Assessment Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-BHV (Behavioral/Psychiatric Documentation)

code: A-BHV2
parent_rubric: A-BHV
label: Capacity or Consent Assessment Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot does not record the assessment of decision-making capacity
  or consent status in a behavioral case when such context was provided.
  This includes documentation of psychiatric holds (5150), patient
  competence, or implied consent situations.

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "Capacity/consent status fully documented"
    0.90: "Excellent - key assessment captured"
    0.80: "Good - partial capacity info present"
    0.0: "Failed - capacity assessment omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains capacity assessment ("patient deemed
  incompetent," "lacks decision-making capacity"), psychiatric hold status
  ("5150 hold," "involuntary transport"), or consent documentation for
  behavioral patients. Flag if the output does not record this information.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-behavioral cases. Do not flag if the narrative does
  not mention capacity or consent. Standard consent in cooperative patients
  does not require explicit documentation unless stated.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Patient on 5150 hold, transported involuntarily' but output has no mention of hold status."
  - "Narrative: 'Patient deemed incompetent due to psychosis, unable to refuse care' but output lacks capacity assessment."
  - "Implied consent: 'Patient intoxicated, unable to provide informed consent, transported under implied consent' - implied consent status must be documented."
  - "Implied consent: 'Patient actively psychotic, lacks capacity to refuse, transported per medical necessity' - incapacity and transport justification should be captured."
  - "Hold authorizer: '5150 hold placed by Officer Jones badge #4521' - when hold authorizer is documented, this information should be preserved."
  - "Capacity with legal hold: 'Patient on M-1 hold per Dr. Smith, lacks capacity due to active suicidal ideation' - hold status, authorizer, and capacity determination all required."
