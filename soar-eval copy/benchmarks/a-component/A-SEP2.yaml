# Benchmark: A-SEP2 — Sepsis Key Elements Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-SEP (Sepsis/Shock Documentation)

code: A-SEP2
parent_rubric: A-SEP
label: Sepsis Key Elements Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to document key sepsis assessment elements when present
  in the narrative: lactate values, suspected infection source, hemodynamic
  parameters (MAP, fluid responsiveness), or vasopressor administration. These
  elements guide treatment escalation and are critical for ED handoff.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All sepsis key elements captured"
    0.90: "Excellent - key sepsis data present"
    0.80: "Good - most elements documented"
    0.0: "Failed - critical sepsis elements omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains sepsis-specific assessment data: lactate
  values, suspected infection source (UTI, pneumonia, cellulitis, abdominal),
  shock indices (MAP, shock index), fluid challenge response, or vasopressor
  use. Flag if this information is missing from the output or if vital trends
  suggesting septic shock are not reflected.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-sepsis cases. Do not flag information not stated in
  the narrative. Minor unit differences (mmol/L vs mg/dL) are acceptable if
  the numeric value is correct.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Lactate 4.2, suspected UTI source' but output has no lactate value or suspected source."
  - "Narrative: 'MAP 58, started norepinephrine drip' but output omits vasopressor documentation."
  - "Narrative: 'qSOFA 2, gave 2L fluid bolus, patient remained hypotensive' - fluid response must be captured."
  - "Narrative: 'Temp 103.2, HR 124, BP 84/52, suspected pneumonia' - vital pattern and suspected source must be preserved."
