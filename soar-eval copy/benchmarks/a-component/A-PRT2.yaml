label: STEMI Care Incomplete

concept: >
  In a STEMI/ACS scenario, Medic Copilot fails to extract stated protocol steps or flag
  gaps that ground truth marks as missing (aspirin, 12-lead, STEMI alert, nitroglycerin).

    0.60: "Fair (60-70% steps documented)"
    0.0: "Failed - critical STEMI steps missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when ground truth marks a test case as STEMI/ACS with expected protocol elements.
  Flag if Medic Copilot's output fails to extract stated interventions or flag gaps.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for non-cardiac cases, when the missing step is appropriately contraindicated
  and this is clearly documented (e.g., aspirin withheld for true allergy), or when local
  protocols legitimately differ on which steps are mandatory.

examples:
  - "Inferior STEMI case where IV and nitroglycerin are documented but no aspirin and no STEMI alert or cath lab activation appear in the output."
  - "12-lead with clear ST elevation recorded in evidence, but the structured protocol branch does not reflect the STEMI pathway or any escalation."
