# Benchmark: A-CAR1 — ROSC/Termination Not Documented
# Parent Rubric: A-CAR (Cardiac Arrest Documentation)

code: A-CAR1
parent_rubric: A-CAR
label: ROSC or Termination Not Documented

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to record the outcome of a cardiac arrest when the
  narrative clearly indicates whether the patient achieved ROSC (return of
  spontaneous circulation) or was pronounced/terminated in the field.

weight: 0.60
threshold: 0.95
criticality: hard_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "Arrest outcome clearly documented"
    0.95: "Excellent - ROSC or termination captured"
    0.50: "Partial - outcome implied but not explicit"
    0.0: "Failed - arrest outcome missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes a cardiac arrest and states an outcome:
  ROSC with timestamp, field pronouncement, or termination of resuscitation.
  Flag if the output does not clearly reflect this outcome.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-arrest cases. Do not apply when the narrative itself
  is ambiguous about outcome (e.g., ongoing CPR during transport with no
  stated outcome).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Pulses regained at 08:32, ROSC achieved' but output has no ROSC documentation."
  - "Narrative: 'No ROSC after 25 minutes, termination called by medical control' but output lacks pronouncement."
  - "ROSC time required: 'ROSC at 08:32' must include timestamp in output, not just 'ROSC achieved' without time."
  - "Termination time required: 'Resuscitation terminated at 14:47 per Dr. Martinez' - termination time must be captured, not just 'terminated.'"
  - "Field termination with base contact: 'After 30 minutes of resuscitation with no ROSC, contacted base. Dr. Chen authorized field termination at 0923.' - outcome (no ROSC), base contact, physician name, and termination time all required."
