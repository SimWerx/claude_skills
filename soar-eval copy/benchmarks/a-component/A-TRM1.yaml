# Benchmark: A-TRM1 — GCS/Neuro Assessment Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-TRM (Trauma Documentation)

code: A-TRM1
parent_rubric: A-TRM
label: GCS or Neuro Assessment Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot does not record a Glasgow Coma Scale, mental status, mechanism
  of injury (MOI), or named injuries that were documented for a trauma patient.
  Many EMS narratives include "GCS 13" or a breakdown (E4 V4 M5), plus MOI
  details (MVC, fall from height, GSW) and injury descriptions (femur fracture,
  head laceration, rib fractures). If provided and the AI omits clinically
  significant injuries, that is a failure. Focus on major injuries; minor
  abrasions may be summarized.

  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "GCS/neuro status fully documented"
    0.90: "Excellent - key neuro findings present"
    0.80: "Good - partial GCS or descriptors captured"
    0.0: "Failed - GCS or neuro assessment omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains a GCS score (numeric or components),
  describes level of consciousness for a trauma patient (e.g., "confused,
  eyes opening to voice, localizes pain"), documents mechanism of injury
  (e.g., "MVC rollover," "fall from 20 feet," "GSW to abdomen"), or names
  specific injuries (fractures, lacerations, contusions). Flag if the output
  does not include this information or if clinically significant named injuries
  are missing from the output.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-trauma cases. Do not flag if the narrative does not
  contain GCS or neuro status. Minor format differences (GCS 13 vs E4V4M5)
  are acceptable if clinically equivalent. Minor injuries (small abrasions,
  superficial scratches) may be omitted if major injuries are captured.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'GCS 13, E4 V4 M5, head lac from fall' but output has no GCS or mental status."
  - "Narrative: 'Patient confused, localizes to pain' but output says only 'trauma patient.'"
  - "Narrative: 'MVC rollover at highway speed, ejected from vehicle' but output lacks mechanism of injury detail."
  - "Multi-injury: 'Open femur fracture, rib fractures 4-7 on left, head laceration' - all three injury categories must be captured, not just the femur."
  - "Injury completeness: 'GSW to right chest and left thigh, pneumothorax suspected' - both wound locations and suspected pneumothorax must appear."
