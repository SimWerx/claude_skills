# Benchmark: A-REF2 — Refusal Signature/Witness Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-REF (Refusal Documentation)

code: A-REF2
parent_rubric: A-REF
label: Refusal Signature or Witness Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to record the presence or absence of a refusal signature
  or witness when the narrative states this information. Many narratives include
  "Patient signed refusal form" or "patient refused to sign, witness John Doe"
  and this must be captured in the output.

  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "Signature/witness status fully documented"
    0.85: "Good - key signature info present"
    0.70: "Fair - partial signature documentation"
    0.0: "Failed - signature/witness info omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative explicitly mentions signature status ("signed AMA,"
  "refused to sign," "witness present") or identifies a witness by name. Flag if
  the output does not include this information.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply if the narrative does not mention signature or witness status.
  Do not flag minor formatting differences if the essential information
  (signed/not signed, witness name if given) is preserved.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Patient signed refusal form, witnessed by spouse' but output has no mention of signature or witness."
  - "Narrative: 'Patient refused to sign, firefighter Jones witnessed refusal' but output omits witness documentation."
  - "High-risk post-intervention: 'Post-Narcan patient signed AMA form, witnessed by partner on scene and PD Officer Davis badge #4521' - signature status and both witnesses must be captured given medicolegal importance of post-reversal refusals."
  - "Post-hypoglycemia refusal: 'Patient refused to sign refusal form, stated doesn't want paperwork. Witnessed by daughter present on scene, Mary Smith.' - refusal to sign and witness identity must be documented."
