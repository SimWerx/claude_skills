# Benchmark: A-PED1 — Pediatric Dosing Error
# Parent Rubric: A-PED (Pediatric Documentation)

code: A-PED1
parent_rubric: A-PED
label: Pediatric Dosing Calculation Error

concept: >
  Medic Copilot's weight-based dosing calculation produces an incorrect result
  compared to ground truth (e.g., 0.01 mg/kg × 20 kg should be 0.2 mg, not 0.01 mg
  or 2.0 mg).

weight: 0.60
threshold: 0.95
criticality: hard_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All pediatric doses correctly calculated"
    0.95: "Excellent - no dosing calculation errors"
    0.80: "Minor rounding differences only"
    0.0: "Failed - pediatric dose calculation error"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when ground truth marks a pediatric test case with known-correct
  weight-based dose. Flag if Medic Copilot's calculated dose differs from
  ground truth.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to adult patients. Do not flag when dose is absent (use
  completeness codes). Do not flag trivial rounding differences that don't
  change clinical dose range (e.g., 0.195 mg vs 0.2 mg is acceptable).
  Correct weight unit conversions are acceptable (e.g., 44 lbs = 20 kg).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg for 20 kg child (~0.2 mg)' but output records 0.01 mg or 2.0 mg."
  - "Broselow tape indicates 15 kg, medication dose given matches adult dose range."
  - "ACCEPTABLE: Child weighs 44 lbs (20 kg), dose calculated using 20 kg is correct conversion."
  - "ACCEPTABLE: Calculated dose 0.195 mg rounded to 0.2 mg - trivial rounding is not an error."
