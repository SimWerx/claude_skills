# Benchmark: A-CMP6-airport — Airport Transfer Field Completeness
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)
# Source: airport-transfer-fields-incomplete.yaml

code: A-CMP6-airport
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Airport Transfer Fields Incomplete

concept: >
  In aeromedical ground-transfer scenarios, key transfer fields (air transport agency, tail
  number, destination, diagnosis, reason for transfer, diagnosis source, or flight crew vs
  SMFR roles) are missing or too vague in Medic Copilot's output.

    1.0: "All airport transfer fields complete"
    0.85: "Excellent (85%+ fields present)"
    0.70: "Good (70-85% fields present)"
    0.60: "Fair (60-70% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - critical transfer fields missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the call is clearly an airport/flight transfer. Flag if the structured output
  omits any of: named air transport agency, aircraft tail number, destination facility,
  specific diagnosis, specific clinical reason for transfer, explicit diagnosis source, or
  whether the flight crew vs ground crew carried primary responsibility for care.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for standard ground transports with no aeromedical component, or when all fields
  are present but the narrative simply adds extra contextual detail.

examples:
  - "Airport-transfer trace that documents diagnosis and destination but never records aircraft tail number."
  - "Output says 'transferred for higher level of care' with no specific reason despite more detailed rationale in the source narrative."
