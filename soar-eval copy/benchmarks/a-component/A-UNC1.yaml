# Benchmark: A-UNC1 — Hallucination on Missing Data
# Parent Rubric: A-UNC (Uncertainty Handling)

code: A-UNC1
parent_rubric: A-UNC
label: Hallucinated Data for Missing Input

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fills in a value for a field when the narrative provides no evidence
  for that information. This is fabrication — inventing data that was never stated
  in the transcript. Zero tolerance for this failure mode as it creates false
  documentation that could affect patient care decisions.

weight: 0.60
threshold: 1.0
criticality: hard_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "No hallucinated values — all output fields supported by narrative"
    0.0: "Failed — one or more values fabricated without narrative support"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the structured output contains a specific value (not null, not "unknown")
  for a field. Flag if the narrative/ASR text provides no evidence for that value and
  the AI has invented information to fill a gap. Common targets: allergies, secondary
  vital signs, patient demographics, medication details not stated.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when the value is legitimately inferred from explicit narrative context,
  when the field is appropriately populated with "unknown" or null, or when the issue is
  misinterpretation of stated data rather than fabrication (use A-FCT or A-NEG instead).

examples:
  - "Narrative never mentions allergies, but output populates allergies: 'NKDA' — fabricated assumption."
  - "No second set of vitals in narrative, yet output includes full reassessment_vitals object with invented values."
  - "Patient weight not stated in transcript, but output records weight: 80 — hallucinated value."
  - "Narrative provides no medication history, but output lists home_medications: ['metformin', 'lisinopril']."
