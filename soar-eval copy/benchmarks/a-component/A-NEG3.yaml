# Benchmark: A-NEG3 — Implicit/Hedged Negation Handling
# Parent Rubric: A-NEG (Negation Handling)

code: A-NEG3
parent_rubric: A-NEG
label: Implicit or Hedged Negation Misinterpretation

concept: >
  Implicit negation (absence implied by context) or hedged language (uncertain denials,
  qualified negatives) are mishandled such that Medic Copilot encodes incorrect clinical
  polarity or fails to capture the uncertainty appropriately.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All implicit/hedged negations correctly interpreted"
    0.80: "Good (80%+ correct)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% correct)"
    0.60: "Poor (60-70% correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - implicit negations systematically mishandled"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains implicit negation (absence inferred from context, e.g.,
  'focused on cardiac, lungs clear' implies no respiratory complaint) or hedged language
  (e.g., 'patient unsure if chest pain', 'possibly denies'). Flag if output encodes definitive
  polarity conflicting with ground truth.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for explicit negation ('denies X') or clear double negatives ('not denying').
  Use A-NEG1 for simple negation, A-NEG2 for double negatives.

examples:
  - "Text: 'patient unsure about chest pain' but output records chest_pain: false definitively."
  - "'lungs clear bilaterally' implies no respiratory distress, but output leaves respiratory fields blank."
  - "'possibly had some nausea earlier' encoded as nausea: true without uncertainty flag."
  - "'only mild pain' - 'mild' hedges severity but pain is present; output must not record as no_pain."
  - "'nothing further to report' - implicit negation of additional complaints; should not invent findings."
  - "'just some discomfort' - hedged symptom that should be captured with appropriate uncertainty."
  - "Partial denial: 'denies chest pain, just mild soreness' - soreness is present (partial admission); output must not encode as chest_pain: false."
  - "Partial denial: 'no real shortness of breath, maybe a little winded' - respiratory symptom is partially present; output must capture with appropriate hedging."
