# Benchmark: A-TRM3 — Trauma Alert Not Documented
# Parent Rubric: A-TRM (Trauma Documentation)

code: A-TRM3
parent_rubric: A-TRM
label: Trauma Alert Not Documented

concept: >
  Medic Copilot output does not document that a trauma alert was called when
  the narrative explicitly states it. If the narrative says "Trauma alert
  activated, ETA 5 minutes" or "Called trauma alert to receiving facility"
  and the output omits this, that is a failure. Parallels A-STR2 for stroke
  alert documentation.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "Trauma alert fully documented"
    0.80: "Partial - trauma destination noted but alert not explicit"
    0.50: "Minimal - trauma center mentioned without alert status"
    0.0: "Failed - trauma alert omitted entirely"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative explicitly states a trauma alert was called or
  activated (e.g., "trauma alert," "level 1 trauma," "trauma team activated,"
  "notified trauma center"). Flag if the output does not reflect this alert status.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when no trauma alert is mentioned in the narrative. Do not
  flag if the patient was transported to a trauma center without an explicit
  alert being called - only flag when the alert itself is documented and
  omitted from output.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Trauma alert activated, ETA 5 minutes' but output has no mention of trauma alert."
  - "Narrative: 'Called level 1 trauma to Memorial, trauma team notified' but output says only 'Transported to Memorial.'"
  - "Narrative: 'Notified receiving facility of incoming trauma alert' but output omits alert notification."
  - "Trauma alert level: 'Level 1 trauma activated due to hemodynamic instability' - alert level (1 vs 2) should be captured when specified."
  - "Trauma alert with criteria: 'Trauma alert called: penetrating torso injury, GCS 12, SBP 88' - alert criteria mentioned should be documented alongside alert status."
