# Benchmark: A-CMP1 — Core DRAATT Section Completeness
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)
# Source: core-draatt-sections-missing.yaml

code: A-CMP1
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Core DRAATT Sections Missing

concept: >
  Required DRAATT sections for the call type (e.g., dispatch, response, arrival, assessment,
  treatment, transport/refusal) are not documented at all in Medic Copilot's structured output.

weight: 0.167
threshold: 0.85
criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All required sections present"
    0.85: "Excellent (85%+ sections present)"
    0.70: "Good (70-85% sections present)"
    0.60: "Fair (60-70% sections present)"
    0.0: "Failed - core sections missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the template or scenario type requires a core DRAATT section. Flag if that section
  is completely absent from `draatt_json` (no fields, no empty stubs), or clearly conflated
  into another section so that section-level completeness cannot be trusted.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when a section is present but internally incomplete (use more specific assessment,
  treatment, or transport axial codes), or when the scenario legitimately omits that section
  by design (e.g., RSI overlay omitting dispatch/arrival).

examples:
  - "Full-draatt trace where no Response or Transport fields exist anywhere in `draatt_json`."
  - "Airport-transfer trace where Transfer/Transport information is documented only in free text with no structured section."
  - "Section conflation: Assessment and Treatment content merged into a single unstructured block, preventing section-level completeness validation."
  - "Section conflation: Dispatch and Response sections combined so that response delays cannot be distinguished from dispatch timing."

evaluator_type: code

notes: >
  This benchmark covers all six DRAATT section completeness checks. Individual section
  weights should be distributed as: Dispatch (A-CMP1), Response (A-CMP2), Arrival (A-CMP3),
  Assessment (A-CMP4), Treatment (A-CMP5), Transport (A-CMP6).
