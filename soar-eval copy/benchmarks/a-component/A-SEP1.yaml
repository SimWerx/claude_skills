# Benchmark: A-SEP1 — Sepsis Alert Activation
# Parent Rubric: A-SEP (Sepsis/Shock Documentation)

code: A-SEP1
parent_rubric: A-SEP
label: Sepsis Alert Not Documented

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to document sepsis alert activation when it occurred.
  If the narrative states "activated sepsis alert" or "called sepsis code to
  receiving facility" and the output does not reflect this notification, that
  is a failure. Alert timing and receiving facility acknowledgment are critical
  for time-to-treatment metrics.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "Sepsis alert activation fully documented"
    0.95: "Excellent - alert status captured"
    0.80: "Good - partial alert documentation"
    0.0: "Failed - sepsis alert omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes activating a sepsis alert, sepsis code,
  or notifying the receiving facility of suspected sepsis (e.g., "activated
  sepsis alert," "called sepsis notification to ED," "qSOFA of 3, notified
  hospital"). Flag if the output does not capture this notification or its
  timing when stated.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-sepsis cases. Do not apply when sepsis is suspected
  but no formal alert was activated. Do not flag if the narrative does not
  mention alert activation. Clinical suspicion without alert is acceptable
  if narrative reflects the same.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Activated sepsis alert to Memorial ED, ETA 10 minutes' but output lacks any mention of sepsis alert."
  - "Narrative: 'qSOFA 3, called sepsis code' but output says only 'suspected infection.'"
  - "Narrative: 'Sepsis protocol initiated, notified receiving hospital at 14:32' - alert timing must be captured."
