# Benchmark: A-CMP4 — Assessment Section Incomplete
# Parent Rubric: A-CMP (Completeness)

code: A-CMP4
parent_rubric: A-CMP
label: Assessment Section Incomplete

concept: >
  Medic Copilot's output is missing significant Assessment findings that were documented in
  the narrative. This benchmark targets omissions in the physical exam and primary/secondary
  survey details within the assessment section.

weight: 0.15
threshold: 0.80

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All assessment section fields present"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ fields present)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% fields present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - assessment section incomplete"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative provides a thorough patient assessment (e.g., vital signs, Glasgow
  Coma Scale, head-to-toe exam findings across systems). Flag if the output fails to capture
  one or more critical components, for instance if the transcript includes a neurological exam
  and GCS but the output assessment lacks any neuro status or GCS field.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use if the scenario's narrative itself is limited (e.g., focused exam only) and those
  details are not present to extract. Also exclude if the missing content pertains to a
  different rubric (e.g., omission of treatment details belongs in completeness of treatment,
  not assessment).

examples:
  - "The narrative lists vital signs and a 12-system exam (HEENT, chest, abdomen, etc.), but the output's assessment section contains only vitals and omits entire system exams (e.g., no neurological or no abdominal findings recorded)."
  - "Narrative: 'GCS 15, pupils equal and reactive, lungs clear bilaterally, no neurologic deficits'. Output: no GCS documented and no mention of neuro exam findings in assessment."
