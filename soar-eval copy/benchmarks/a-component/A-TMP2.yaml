code: A-TMP2
parent_rubric: A-TMP
label: Pre/Post Trend Misinterpreted

concept: >
  Pre/post comparisons or trends (e.g., pain score, vitals, neurologic status) are recorded
  incorrectly, reversed, or omitted in Medic Copilot's output relative to ground truth.

weight: 0.20
threshold: 0.85
criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All trends correctly captured"
    0.85: "Excellent (85%+ trends correct)"
    0.70: "Good (70-85% trends correct)"
    0.60: "Fair (60-70% trends correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - trends systematically wrong"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when there are clear before-and-after values in the narrative or labels. Flag if
  the structured output swaps them (improvement recorded as worsening), fails to show any
  change, or fabricates a trend unsupported by evidence.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use when pre/post values are truly missing from the source narrative, or when small
  numerical differences do not alter the qualitative trend.

examples:
  - "'pain 8/10 improved to 4/10 after fentanyl' but output records pain_trend as 'worsened'."
  - "EtCO2 values present both pre- and post-intubation, but only the initial value is recorded and no trend field is set."
  - "Pediatric HR 180 improving to 160 after fluid bolus, but output records only initial HR or marks trend as 'worsened'."
