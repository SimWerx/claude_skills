# Benchmark: A-STR1 — Stroke Scale Omitted
# Parent Rubric: A-STR (Stroke Documentation)

code: A-STR1
parent_rubric: A-STR
label: Stroke Scale or Neuro Findings Omitted

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to include a documented stroke assessment score or
  neurological exam findings. If the narrative states "LAMS score 4" or
  "facial droop and arm drift present, speech slurred (Cincinnati positive)"
  and the output does not reflect these findings, that is a failure.

weight: 0.50

criticality: threshold_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All stroke scale/neuro findings captured"
    0.90: "Excellent - key findings present"
    0.80: "Good - most neuro findings documented"
    0.0: "Failed - stroke assessment omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative contains stroke scale scores (LAMS, CPSS, FAST,
  RACE, NIHSS) or describes specific neurological findings (facial droop,
  arm drift, speech difficulty, gaze deviation) in a suspected stroke case.
  Flag if this information is missing from the output, or if multiple stroke
  scales are documented (e.g., both CPSS and LAMS) but not all are captured.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-stroke cases. Do not flag minor wording differences
  if the clinical content is preserved (e.g., "facial asymmetry" vs "facial
  droop" is acceptable).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'LAMS score 4, facial droop present' but output has no stroke scale or neuro findings."
  - "Narrative: 'Cincinnati positive - arm drift, slurred speech' but output says only 'possible stroke.'"
  - "Multiple scales: 'CPSS positive, LAMS 4' - both scales should be captured, not just one."
  - "Scale with components: 'FAST positive: facial droop left side, arm drift left, speech slurred, time of onset 0830' - individual FAST components should be documented, not just 'FAST positive.'"
  - "NIHSS documented: 'NIHSS 14 per receiving facility telestroke' - NIHSS score and source should be captured when provided."
