# Benchmark: A-REF3 — Base Contact Omitted
# Parent Rubric: A-REF (Refusal Documentation)

code: A-REF3
parent_rubric: A-REF
label: Base Contact Omitted

concept: >
  Medic Copilot output does not include physician name or advice when the
  narrative states that base station was contacted. If the narrative says
  "Contacted base: spoke with Dr. Adams who agrees with field termination"
  and the output omits Dr. Adams or the consultation details, that is a failure.
  Per Denver 0032, physician name is required if base was contacted for refusal.

    0.50: "Minimal - only vague mention of consultation"
    0.0: "Failed - base contact omitted entirely"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes contacting base station, medical control,
  or online physician (e.g., "contacted base," "called medical control,"
  "spoke with Dr. [name]"). Flag if the output does not reflect that this
  consultation occurred or does not include physician name when stated.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when no base contact is mentioned in the narrative. Do not
  flag if the narrative mentions contacting base but does not name the
  physician - only flag if the consultation itself is omitted.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Contacted base: spoke with Dr. Adams who agrees with field termination' but output omits Dr. Adams."
  - "Narrative: 'Called medical control, Dr. Smith advised refusal acceptable' but output says only 'Patient refused.'"
  - "Narrative: 'Contacted base for refusal authorization' but output has no mention of base contact."
  - "High-risk post-naloxone: 'Given high-risk nature of post-Narcan refusal, contacted medical control per protocol. Dr. Chen at Denver Health advised acceptable to release given documented capacity and patient understanding of re-sedation risk. Patient to call 911 if drowsy.' - physician name, advice, and discharge instructions must all be captured."
  - "Post-hypoglycemia base contact: 'Contacted base for diabetic refusal guidance, Dr. Williams advised ensure patient eats and has glucometer, acceptable to release.' - base physician name and specific guidance must be preserved."
