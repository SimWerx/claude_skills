code: A-NEG1
parent_rubric: A-NEG
label: Simple Negation Misinterpretation

concept: >
  Straightforward denials or negated symptoms in the narrative (e.g., 'denies chest pain',
  'no shortness of breath', 'negative for fever', 'without nausea') are encoded incorrectly
  in Medic Copilot's structured fields.

    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ correct)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% correct)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% correct)"
    0.0: "Failed - negations systematically misinterpreted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when clear single-layer negation appears in ASR/narrative or ground truth. Flag if
  the output records the corresponding symptom or condition as present rather than absent,
  or leaves it unknown despite an explicit denial.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for complex or double-negative phrasing (use the complex-negation axial code),
  or when extraction failure is not related to negation (e.g., symptom never parsed at all).

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'patient denies chest pain or SOB,' but DRAATT JSON marks chest_pain: true."
  - "Negative symptom list in ground truth includes 'fever' but output leaves fever unset."
  - "Narrative: 'negative for abdominal pain' but output marks abdominal_pain: true."
  - "Narrative: 'without nausea or vomiting' but output records nausea as present."
