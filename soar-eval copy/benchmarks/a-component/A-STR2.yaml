# Benchmark: A-STR2 — Last Known Well or Stroke Alert Missing
# Parent Rubric: A-STR (Stroke Documentation)

code: A-STR2
parent_rubric: A-STR
label: Last Known Well or Stroke Alert Missing

concept: >
  Medic Copilot output does not record the "last known well" (LKW) timestamp
  or the hospital stroke alert notification when the narrative contained this
  information. LKW is critical for tPA/thrombectomy eligibility decisions and
  must be captured when stated.

weight: 0.50
threshold: 0.95
criticality: hard_gate

scoring_scale:
  min_value: 0.0
  max_value: 1.0
  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "LKW and stroke alert fully documented"
    0.95: "Excellent - critical timing info present"
    0.80: "Good - LKW present but alert missing or vice versa"
    0.0: "Failed - LKW or stroke alert omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative states a last known well time (e.g., "last known
  well at 14:25 per family," "patient was fine at breakfast") or mentions
  stroke alert activation ("stroke alert called to receiving hospital"). Flag if
  this information is missing from the output.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-stroke cases. Do not apply if the narrative itself
  is ambiguous about LKW. When the narrative explicitly states "LKW unknown"
  or "unknown when symptoms started," capturing this as "unknown" in the
  output is acceptable and should not be penalized. Minor time format
  differences are acceptable.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Last known well at 14:25 per family, stroke alert called' but output has no LKW time."
  - "Narrative: 'Wife states patient was normal at 0800, stroke alert activated' but output lacks both LKW and alert mention."
  - "ACCEPTABLE - LKW unknown: Narrative states 'patient found down, unknown when symptoms started, family unsure of last normal' - output may mark LKW as 'unknown' rather than inventing a time."
  - "ACCEPTABLE - LKW unknown: 'Woke with symptoms, last seen normal last night around 2200' - approximate LKW is acceptable ('approximately 2200' or 'last night')."
  - "Wake-up stroke: 'Patient woke at 0630 with left-sided weakness, went to bed normal at 2300' - LKW is 2300 (last known normal), not 0630 (symptom discovery)."
