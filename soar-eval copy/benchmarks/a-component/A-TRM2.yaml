# Benchmark: A-TRM2 — Critical Trauma Intervention Omitted
# Parent Rubric: A-TRM (Trauma Documentation)

code: A-TRM2
parent_rubric: A-TRM
label: Critical Trauma Intervention Omitted

concept: >
  Medic Copilot fails to document a major trauma intervention that was
  performed according to the narrative. Examples include tourniquet
  application, wound packing, needle decompression, and pelvic binder
  placement. These life-saving procedures must appear in the output.

  normalization_formula: "x"
  descriptions:
    1.0: "All critical interventions documented"
    0.95: "Excellent - life-saving procedures captured"
    0.80: "Good - most interventions present"
    0.0: "Failed - critical intervention omitted"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative describes a major trauma intervention such as
  tourniquet application (with time if stated), wound packing, needle
  decompression, pelvic binder, or chest seal. Flag if the output does not
  include these in the Treatment section.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply to non-trauma cases. Do not apply if the narrative does
  not mention these specific interventions. Minor wording differences
  are acceptable if the procedure is clearly documented.

examples:
  - "Narrative: 'Tourniquet applied to left leg at 12:00' but output has no mention of tourniquet."
  - "Narrative: 'Needle decompression right chest for tension pneumo' but output says only 'chest injury treated.'"
  - "Pelvic binder: 'Suspected pelvic fracture, SAM pelvic sling applied' - pelvic binder/sling must be documented as critical hemorrhage control intervention."
  - "Cricothyrotomy: 'Unable to intubate, surgical airway performed at 1432' - cricothyrotomy is a critical intervention; time and procedure must be captured."
  - "Tourniquet time: 'CAT tourniquet applied 1215, high and tight on right thigh' - tourniquet time is critical for hospital handoff and must be preserved."
  - "Wound packing: 'Packed junctional wound with hemostatic gauze' - hemorrhage control interventions must be documented."
