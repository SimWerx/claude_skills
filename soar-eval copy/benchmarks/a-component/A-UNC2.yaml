# Benchmark: A-UNC2 — Silent Omission of Critical Field
# Parent Rubric: A-UNC (Uncertainty Handling)

code: A-UNC2
parent_rubric: A-UNC
label: Silent Omission of Critical Field

concept: >
  A required or high-liability documentation field is left blank (null or absent)
  without any acknowledgment that the information was not available in the narrative.
  The AI should flag critical absent fields rather than silently omitting them.
  Critical fields include: capacity_assessment (refusals), risks_explained (refusals),
  pronouncement_time (DOA), consent documentation (behavioral), and protocol-required
  fields (RSI doses, STEMI times). Capacity is especially critical in refusal
  scenarios for medicolegal protection.

    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ critical omissions flagged)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% critical omissions flagged)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% critical omissions flagged)"
    0.0: "Failed — critical fields silently omitted without acknowledgment"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the narrative genuinely lacks information for a high-liability or required field
  and the output leaves it blank without any flag or "unknown" marker. Flag if critical fields
  like risks_explained, pronouncement_time, capacity_assessment, or consent documentation are
  silently omitted without acknowledgment.

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not apply when the field is optional or low-priority, when the output appropriately marks
  the field as "unknown" or includes a data_gap flag, when the narrative contains the information
  but AI failed to extract it (use A-CMP instead), or when null is the accurate representation.

examples:
  - "Refusal case: narrative never states risks were explained, output leaves risks_explained blank without 'unknown' flag — silent gap in high-liability field."
  - "DOA case: pronouncement_time field is null without any acknowledgment that time was not documented in narrative."
  - "Behavioral case: capacity_assessment missing entirely, no flag indicating narrative lacked this information."
  - "RSI case: paralytic_dose field blank without noting the narrative omitted this detail."
  - "POSITIVE example - correct handling: DOA narrative states 'time of death not documented by first responders' and output marks pronouncement_time as 'unknown' with data_gap flag - this is correct behavior."
  - "POSITIVE example - correct handling: Refusal narrative omits capacity assessment, output sets capacity_assessment to 'not documented' and flags as data_gap - appropriate acknowledgment of missing critical field."
  - "POSITIVE example - correct handling: RSI narrative mentions sedation but not paralytic, output marks paralytic_dose as 'not stated in narrative' - explicit acknowledgment rather than silent null."
