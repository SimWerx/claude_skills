label: RSI Critical Fields Incomplete

concept: >
  In an RSI scenario, Medic Copilot fails to document one or more critical RSI elements such
  as indication, preoxygenation details, sedative and paralytic doses, ETT size/depth, or
  EtCO2 confirmation. Also includes post-intubation sedation/analgesia documentation if
  mentioned in narrative.

  descriptions:
    1.0: "All RSI critical fields complete"
    0.90: "Excellent (90%+ fields present)"
    0.80: "Good (80-90% fields present)"
    0.70: "Fair (70-80% fields present)"
    0.0: "Failed - RSI critical fields missing"

inclusion_criteria: >
  Apply when the trace clearly involves RSI (advanced endotracheal airway). Flag if the output
  omits either the sedative or neuromuscular blocker (or their doses), lacks ETT size or
  depth, fails to document a numeric EtCO2, provides fewer than two confirmation methods
  despite a successful intubation being claimed, or omits the number of intubation attempts
  if explicitly stated in the narrative (e.g., "2 attempts" must be captured).

exclusion_criteria: >
  Do not use for basic airway or supraglottic airways, or when all required RSI fields are
  present but stylistically terse.

examples:
  - "RSI overlay where ketamine is documented but no paralytic or paralytic dose appears in `draatt_json`."
  - "ETT placement recorded with 'tube in good position' but no ETT size, depth, or EtCO2 value."
  - "RSI with '2 intubation attempts' stated in narrative but output records only successful placement without attempt count."
