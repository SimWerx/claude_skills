# Rubric: A-TRM — Trauma Documentation
# Evaluates completeness of trauma-specific documentation

code: A-TRM
label: Trauma Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates documentation of trauma-specific assessments and interventions
  including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), mechanism of injury, and critical
  trauma procedures (tourniquet, needle decompression, pelvic binder).
  Critical because missing GCS affects trauma triage and missing
  life-saving interventions can compromise continuity of care.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Is GCS or mental status documented for trauma patients?"
    - "Are critical trauma interventions (tourniquet, decompression) captured?"
    - "Is mechanism of injury documented when stated?"
    - "Are neuro exam findings preserved for head injuries?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "GCS expressed as total or components (E4V4M5 vs GCS 13)"
    - "Minor wording differences in mechanism description"
  critical_requirements:
    - "GCS MUST be documented if stated in narrative"
    - "Life-saving interventions MUST appear in Treatment section"
    - "Tourniquet time MUST be captured if documented"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Trauma documentation check: (1) GCS/neuro status,
    (2) critical interventions, (3) mechanism if stated.

benchmarks:
  - A-TRM1  # GCS/neuro assessment missing
  - A-TRM2  # Critical trauma intervention omitted
  - A-TRM3  # Trauma alert not documented
