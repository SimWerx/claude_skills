# Rubric: A-NEG — Negation Handling
# Evaluates correct interpretation of negated clinical findings
# SME REVIEW: Consider raising passing_threshold from 0.85 to 0.90 given medicolegal risk

code: A-NEG
label: Negation Handling
description: >
  Measures accuracy in interpreting negated clinical findings. Simple negation
  (denies X, no Y) and complex patterns (double negatives, implicit negation,
  hedged language) must be correctly encoded to avoid dangerous polarity errors.

weight: 0.125
aggregation_method: WEIGHTED_AVERAGE
passing_threshold: 0.90

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are simple negation phrases (denies X, no Y) correctly interpreted?"
    - "Are complex negation patterns (double negatives, implicit) handled?"
    - "Are internal contradictions flagged or resolved?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Minor wording differences that preserve clinical meaning"
    - "Grouping related negatives into a single statement"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Simple negation must never flip polarity"
    - "Double negatives must resolve to correct clinical state"
    - "Contradictions must be flagged, not silently ignored"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Negation analysis showing: (1) identified negation phrases,
    (2) resolved polarity, (3) contradiction detection.

benchmarks:
  - A-NEG1  # Simple negation (denies X, no Y)
  - A-NEG2  # Complex negation - double negatives
  - A-NEG3  # Complex negation - implicit/hedged
  - A-NEG4  # Contradiction detection
