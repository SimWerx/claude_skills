evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are all required DRAATT sections present?"
    - "Are template-specific fields populated?"
    - "Are transport/handoff details complete?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Sections legitimately omitted by design (e.g., RSI overlay)"
    - "Concise but complete section content"
    - "Combined sections when clinically appropriate"
    - "Coroner/ME notification may be absent if not required by local protocol"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Core sections for template type must exist"
    - "Template-specific critical fields must be populated"
    - "Transport/refusal disposition must be documented"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Section coverage map showing: (1) required sections per template,
    (2) populated vs missing sections, (3) field-level completeness.
