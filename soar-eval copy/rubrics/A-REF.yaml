# Rubric: A-REF — Refusal Documentation
# Evaluates completeness of patient refusal documentation

code: A-REF
label: Refusal Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates documentation of patient refusal scenarios including explanation

  or witness documentation. Critical because refusals are the highest
  medicolegal risk area in EMS - lawsuits often hinge on what was told to
  the patient who refused care or transport.
