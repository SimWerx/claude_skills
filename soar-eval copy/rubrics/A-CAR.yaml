# Rubric: A-CAR — Cardiac Arrest Documentation
# Evaluates completeness of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest documentation

code: A-CAR
label: Cardiac Arrest Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates documentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events including
  ROSC or termination outcome, initial rhythm, defibrillation details, and
  resuscitation medications. Critical for clinical handoff, QA review, and
  Utstein-style outcome reporting.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Is ROSC time or termination/pronouncement documented?"
    - "Is initial cardiac rhythm captured?"
    - "Are defibrillation events and counts recorded?"
    - "Are resuscitation medications (epinephrine, amiodarone) documented?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Exact shock times may vary slightly if count is correct"
    - "Drug doses may be grouped if all administrations captured"
  critical_requirements:
    - "ROSC or termination outcome MUST be documented if it occurred"
    - "Initial rhythm must be stated if present in narrative"
    - "Defibrillation must be noted if shocks were delivered"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Cardiac arrest documentation check: (1) outcome (ROSC/death),
    (2) rhythm identification, (3) intervention timeline.
