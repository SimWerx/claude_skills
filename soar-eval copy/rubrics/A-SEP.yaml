# Rubric: A-SEP — Sepsis/Shock Documentation
# Evaluates completeness of sepsis and shock-specific documentation

code: A-SEP
label: Sepsis and Shock Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates documentation of sepsis and shock-specific assessment findings
  including sepsis alert activation, lactate values, suspected infection source,
  and hemodynamic status. Critical because sepsis is time-sensitive with the
  "golden hour" concept - early recognition and treatment significantly impacts
  mortality. Vasopressor use and fluid resuscitation decisions depend on
  accurate documentation.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Is sepsis alert activation documented when it occurred?"
    - "Are lactate values captured when measured?"
    - "Is suspected infection source documented when identified?"
    - "Are vital trend patterns (MAP, HR, temp) indicating shock preserved?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Lactate expressed as mmol/L or mg/dL if value is correct"
    - "Sepsis criteria documented without explicit 'sepsis alert' if clinically equivalent"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Sepsis alert activation MUST be documented if it occurred"
    - "Lactate values MUST be captured if measured in field"
    - "Vasopressor use MUST be documented if administered"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Sepsis/shock documentation check: (1) alert activation status,
    (2) lactate and key labs, (3) suspected source, (4) hemodynamic support.

benchmarks:
  - A-SEP1  # Sepsis alert activation
  - A-SEP2  # Key sepsis elements (lactate, source, trends)
