# Rubric: A-PED — Pediatric Documentation
# Evaluates accuracy of pediatric-specific documentation

code: A-PED
label: Pediatric Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates accuracy of pediatric-specific documentation including weight-based
  medication dosing calculations, age-appropriate assessments, and Broselow
  tape/weight documentation. Critical because all pediatric medications are
  dosed by weight; a 10-fold error can be fatal. Note: APGAR scores for newborn
  deliveries are primarily owned by A-OBS1 (obstetric context); A-PED focuses
  on pediatric patient assessments where the patient is the child, not the
  delivering mother.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are weight-based medication doses calculated correctly?"
    - "Is patient weight or Broselow color documented when stated?"
    - "Are age-appropriate assessment findings included?"
    - "Are pediatric-specific exam findings (cap refill, fontanelle) captured?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Minor weight rounding that doesn't affect dose calculation"
    - "Broselow color vs exact weight when either provides dosing guidance"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Weight-based dose calculations must not have decimal errors"
    - "Patient weight or Broselow color must appear in output if documented in transcript"
    - "Broselow-derived weight estimates must be captured when tape color is stated"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Pediatric documentation check: (1) dose calculation accuracy,
    (2) weight/Broselow capture, (3) age-appropriate assessments.
