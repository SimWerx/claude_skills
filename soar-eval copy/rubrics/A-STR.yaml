# Rubric: A-STR — Stroke Documentation
# Evaluates completeness of stroke-specific documentation

code: A-STR
label: Stroke Documentation
description: >
  Evaluates documentation of stroke-specific assessment findings including
  stroke scale scores (LAMS, CPSS, FAST, RACE, NIHSS), last known well time,
  and stroke alert notification. Critical because stroke is time-sensitive
  like STEMI - LKW time defines eligibility for tPA and thrombectomy.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Is a stroke scale score (LAMS, CPSS, FAST, RACE) documented?"
    - "Is last known well (LKW) time captured?"
    - "Is stroke alert/hospital notification documented?"
    - "Are neuro exam findings (facial droop, arm drift, speech) preserved?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Different stroke scale names if clinical findings are equivalent"
    - "LKW expressed as time or relative description if clear"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Stroke scale score MUST be documented if stated in narrative"
    - "Last known well time MUST be captured if provided"
    - "Stroke alert notification MUST appear if it occurred"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Stroke documentation check: (1) stroke scale/neuro findings,
    (2) last known well time, (3) hospital notification.

benchmarks:
  - A-STR1  # Stroke scale omitted
  - A-STR2  # LKW or stroke alert missing
