# Rubric: A-FCT — Fact Extraction
# Evaluates accuracy of clinical fact extraction from narrative

code: A-FCT
label: Fact Extraction
description: >
  Measures accuracy of extracting clinical facts from narrative into structured
  fields. Includes vital signs, medications, procedures, and diagnostic impressions.
  Errors here directly impact clinical decision support.

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are vital signs extracted with correct values and units?"
    - "Are medications captured with dose, route, and timing?"
    - "Does the structured impression match the clinical picture?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Minor rounding that does not change clinical interpretation"
    - "Equivalent unit conversions (e.g., 98.6F vs 37C)"
    - "Synonym substitution for diagnoses (STEMI vs acute inferior STEMI)"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Vital sign values must match narrative exactly"
    - "Medication doses must be clinically accurate"
    - "Impression must be consistent with documented findings"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Fact extraction validation showing: (1) source spans,
    (2) extracted values, (3) comparison to ground truth.

benchmarks:
  - A-FCT1  # Vitals extraction accuracy
  - A-FCT2  # Medication extraction accuracy
  - A-FCT3  # Procedure extraction accuracy
  - A-FCT4  # Impression/diagnosis match
