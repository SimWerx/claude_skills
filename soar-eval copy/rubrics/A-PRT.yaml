# Rubric: A-PRT — Protocol Tracking
# Evaluates adherence to clinical protocol documentation requirements

code: A-PRT
label: Protocol Tracking
description: >
  Measures documentation of protocol-specific requirements for high-acuity
  scenarios (STEMI, RSI, DOA). These protocols have mandatory documentation
  elements that must be captured for quality assurance and medical-legal purposes.

aggregation_method: WEIGHTED_AVERAGE
passing_threshold: 0.85

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are all critical RSI procedure fields present?"
    - "Is post-intubation sedation documented when mentioned?"
    - "Are STEMI care protocol steps (ASA, 12-lead, alert) present?"
    - "Are DOA pronouncement fields complete?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Protocol variations within accepted regional standards"
    - "Contraindicated steps appropriately withheld with documentation"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Protocol-mandated steps must be documented or contraindication noted"
    - "RSI must include sedative, paralytic, and confirmation"
    - "DOA must include all four pronouncement elements"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Protocol compliance check showing: (1) expected steps per protocol,
    (2) documented steps, (3) omissions with rationale.
