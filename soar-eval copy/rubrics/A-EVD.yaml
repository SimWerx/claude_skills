evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Do key facts have linked evidence spans?"
    - "Do evidence spans actually support the claimed fact?"
    - "Are contradictory spans flagged?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Evidence span includes extra context words"
    - "Multiple valid spans for same fact"
    - "Paraphrased facts with accurate spans"
    - "Fields with no explicit narrative mention but legitimately inferred from context"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Safety-critical facts must have evidence"
    - "Evidence must actually support the claim"
    - "Contradictory evidence must be flagged"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Evidence map validation showing: (1) fact-to-span linkage,
    (2) span content verification, (3) coverage statistics.

benchmarks:
  - A-EVD1  # Evidence span presence
