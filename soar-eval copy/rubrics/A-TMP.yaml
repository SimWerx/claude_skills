# Rubric: A-TMP — Temporal Ordering
# Evaluates correct sequencing and trending of clinical events

code: A-TMP
label: Temporal Ordering
description: >
  Measures accuracy of chronological event sequencing and clinical trend
  interpretation. Incorrect ordering can misrepresent protocol compliance
  and treatment response. Trend errors affect clinical judgment.

weight: 0.125
aggregation_method: WEIGHTED_AVERAGE
passing_threshold: 0.80

evaluation_guidelines:
  focus_areas:
    - "Are clinical events in correct chronological order?"
    - "Are pre/post intervention trends accurately captured?"
    - "Are timestamps preserved when explicitly stated?"
  acceptable_deviations:
    - "Approximate timestamps when source is vague"
    - "Grouping simultaneous events"
    - "Minor reordering within same clinical phase"
  critical_requirements:
    - "Interventions must not precede their prerequisites"
    - "Transport must not precede on-scene assessment"
    - "Trends must reflect actual direction (improved vs worsened)"
  evidence_requirements: >
    Temporal analysis showing: (1) extracted event timeline,
    (2) pre/post value pairs, (3) trend direction validation.

benchmarks:
  - A-TMP1  # Event sequence accuracy
  - A-TMP2  # Pre/post value capture
  - A-TMP3  # Protocol step ordering
  - A-TMP4  # Explicit timing consistency
  - A-TMP5  # Trend direction accuracy
