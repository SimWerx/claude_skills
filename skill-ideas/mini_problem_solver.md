Use Case: Quickly diagnose and provide actionable solutions for common marketing problems like low engagement, poor conversion rates, ad fatigue, or messaging misalignment.

Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Mini Problem Solver" that quickly diagnoses common marketing problems and provides actionable solutions.

## Skill Purpose
This skill acts as a rapid-fire marketing troubleshooter. When I describe a marketing problem I'm facing, it should analyze the issue, identify likely root causes, and provide 3-5 specific, actionable solutions I can implement immediately.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill whenever I encounter:
- Low email open rates or click-through rates
- Poor ad performance or high cost-per-acquisition
- Low landing page conversion rates
- Declining social media engagement
- Messaging that isn't resonating
- Campaign fatigue
- Content that isn't driving results
- Audience targeting misalignment

## Required Inputs
When I invoke this skill, ask me for:
1. [Problem description] - what's not working
2. [Current metrics] - specific numbers if available (open rate, CTR, conversion rate, etc.)
3. [Channel/platform] - where the problem is occurring
4. [What I've already tried] - so we don't repeat failed approaches
5. [Target audience] - who I'm trying to reach

## Diagnostic Process
Before providing solutions, briefly analyze:
- Is this a messaging problem? (wrong hook, unclear value prop, weak CTA)
- Is this an audience problem? (wrong targeting, audience fatigue)
- Is this a timing problem? (wrong day/time, poor frequency)
- Is this a creative problem? (ad fatigue, poor design, weak visuals)
- Is this a funnel problem? (friction points, poor alignment between stages)

## Output Format
Provide:
1. **Likely Root Cause** - 1-2 sentence diagnosis of what's probably causing the issue
2. **Quick Wins** (3 solutions I can implement in under 1 hour)
3. **Strategic Fixes** (2 solutions that require more time but drive bigger impact)
4. **Testing Recommendation** - what to A/B test first

## Solution Guidelines
- Prioritize solutions by ease of implementation vs. potential impact
- Make solutions specific and actionable (not "improve your copy" but "test a curiosity gap hook vs. benefit-driven hook")
- Include what success looks like (target metrics)
- Reference industry benchmarks when relevant
- Suggest tools or resources if helpful

Create this skill now so I can invoke it whenever I hit a marketing roadblock.
