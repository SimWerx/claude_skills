Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "AI Engine Optimization" (AEO) that optimizes content to be discoverable and useful in AI-powered search and answer engines.

## Skill Purpose
This skill helps me optimize content for AI Engine Optimization (AEO) - ensuring my content ranks well when people search using ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI assistants. Unlike traditional SEO, AEO focuses on being the source AI models cite and reference.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill when I need to:
- Optimize blog posts, articles, or web pages for AI citations
- Structure content to be easily parsed by LLMs
- Create content that answers specific queries AI users ask
- Audit existing content for AEO best practices
- Develop FAQ pages or help documentation
- Write product descriptions that AI will recommend

## Required Inputs
When I invoke this skill, ask me for:
1. [Content piece] - paste the content or URL to analyze
2. [Primary topic/keyword] - what query should this rank for
3. [Target audience] - who is searching for this information
4. [Content goal] - inform, convert, educate, compare, etc.
5. [Format] - blog post, product page, FAQ, guide, etc.

## AEO Optimization Checklist
Analyze and provide recommendations for:

### Structure & Formatting
- Use clear, descriptive H2 and H3 headings that answer specific questions
- Include a concise summary or TL;DR at the beginning
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for scannability
- Structure content with question-answer pairs
- Include a table of contents for longer content

### Content Quality
- Provide direct, authoritative answers to common questions
- Include specific data, statistics, and sources
- Use natural language that mirrors how people ask questions
- Define technical terms clearly
- Provide examples and use cases
- Include comparisons when relevant

### Semantic Optimization
- Cover topic clusters comprehensively (don't just focus on one keyword)
- Answer related questions and subtopics
- Use entity-based language (proper nouns, brands, concepts)
- Include context that helps AI understand relationships
- Use schema markup recommendations where applicable

### Citations & Authority
- Link to authoritative sources
- Include author credentials or expertise indicators
- Add publication/update dates
- Reference original research or data
- Use proper attribution

## Output Format
Provide:
1. **AEO Score** (1-10 based on current optimization)
2. **Strengths** - what's already optimized well
3. **Priority Fixes** - 5 specific changes to make immediately
4. **Content Gaps** - questions or topics to add
5. **Structural Recommendations** - how to reorganize for better AI parsing
6. **Sample Optimized Section** - rewrite one section as an example

## Additional Guidelines
- Focus on being the most comprehensive, clear, and authoritative source
- Optimize for "zero-click" answers where AI can directly cite your content
- Consider voice search and conversational query patterns
- Ensure content remains valuable for human readers (don't over-optimize)
