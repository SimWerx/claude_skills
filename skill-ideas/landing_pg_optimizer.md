Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Landing Page Optimizer" that audits and improves landing page copy, structure, and conversion elements using proven CRO principles.

## Skill Purpose
Analyze landing pages for conversion optimization opportunities and provide specific, actionable recommendations to increase conversion rates. Can also generate complete landing page copy from scratch.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill when I need to:
- Audit an underperforming landing page
- Create a new landing page for a product, service, or offer
- Improve conversion rates on lead capture, sales, or signup pages
- A/B test new page variations
- Align page messaging with ad campaigns

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:

**For Audits:**
1. [Landing page URL or full copy] - what to analyze
2. [Current conversion rate] - if known
3. [Traffic source] - where visitors come from (ads, organic, email, etc.)
4. [Goal] - what action visitors should take
5. [Target audience] - who the page is for

**For New Pages:**
1. [Offer/product] - what I'm promoting
2. [Target audience] - who I'm targeting
3. [Traffic source] - how people arrive
4. [Goal] - desired conversion action
5. [Key benefits and objections] - selling points and concerns
6. [Proof elements] - testimonials, stats, case studies available

## Landing Page Audit Framework
Analyze each section:

1. **Headline/Hero Section**
   - Does it communicate value immediately?
   - Is it clear and specific?
   - Does it match visitor intent from traffic source?

2. **Subheadline**
   - Does it expand on the promise?
   - Does it address the "what" and "who"?

3. **Body Copy**
   - Is it benefit-focused (not feature-dumping)?
   - Does it address objections?
   - Is it scannable (headers, bullets, short paragraphs)?
   - Does it build desire and urgency?

4. **Social Proof**
   - Are testimonials specific and credible?
   - Is there third-party validation (awards, press, numbers)?
   - Are objections preemptively handled?

5. **CTA (Call to Action)**
   - Is there one clear primary CTA?
   - Is the CTA button copy action-oriented and benefit-driven?
   - Is there urgency or scarcity?
   - Are there distractions or competing CTAs?

6. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Does the eye flow naturally toward the CTA?
   - Is the page too busy or too sparse?
   - Are trust signals visible above the fold?

7. **Form Friction**
   - Are form fields minimal?
   - Is there a privacy statement?
   - Is the value exchange clear?

## Output Format
Provide:

1. **Conversion Score** (1-10) with rationale
2. **Strengths** - what's working well
3. **Critical Issues** - high-impact problems to fix immediately
4. **Detailed Recommendations** by section:
   - Current state
   - Recommended change
   - Why it will improve conversions
5. **A/B Test Ideas** - 3 specific tests to run
6. **Sample Rewrites** - rewritten sections as examples

For new pages, provide:
- Complete landing page copy in sections (headline, subhead, body, CTA)
- Placement notes for visual elements
- Form field recommendations
- Trust signals to include

## Persuasion Psychology Principles to Apply
- Clarity (remove confusion)
- Relevance (match message to traffic source)
- Value proposition (clear unique benefit)
- Social proof (reduce risk)
- Urgency/scarcity (motivate action now)
- Simplicity (one clear path)
- Reciprocity (give before asking)

Create this skill so I can optimize every landing page for maximum conversions.
