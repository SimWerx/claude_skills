Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Hook Creator" that generates attention-grabbing headlines and hooks for marketing content.

## Skill Purpose
This skill should help me quickly generate 5-10 hook options for any marketing content using proven copywriting frameworks like curiosity gaps, pain-agitation-solution, benefit-driven, contrarian statements, and specific numbers.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill whenever I need to:
- Write email subject lines
- Create social media hooks
- Draft ad headlines
- Write landing page headlines
- Generate video titles or thumbnails text

## Required Inputs
When I invoke this skill, ask me for:
1. [Content type] - email, social post, ad, landing page, etc.
2. [Target audience] - who I'm writing for
3. [Main benefit or promise] - what the content delivers
4. [Tone] - professional, casual, urgent, playful, etc.

## Output Format
Generate 10 hook options using at least 5 different frameworks. For each hook:
- Present the hook text
- Label which framework was used in parentheses
- Keep hooks under 100 characters when possible for platform compatibility

## Hook Frameworks to Use
- Curiosity Gap (incomplete information that demands resolution)
- Pain-Agitation-Solution (call out pain, make it worse, hint at solution)
- Benefit-Driven (lead with clear value)
- Contrarian (challenge common assumptions)
- Specific Numbers (use odd, precise numbers for credibility)
- Question + Benefit (problem question + implied solution)
- Social Proof (leverage popularity or authority)
- Time/Urgency (leverage FOMO or timely relevance)
- Transformation (before â†’ after framing)
- Listicle (numbered format)

## Additional Guidelines
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver on promises
- Test different lengths (short punchy vs. longer descriptive)
- Include at least 2 options that break category norms
- Make hooks specific rather than generic
- Ensure hooks align with brand voice

Create this skill now and save it so I can invoke it whenever I need compelling hooks.
