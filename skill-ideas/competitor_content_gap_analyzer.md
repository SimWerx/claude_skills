Help me create a Skill called "Competitor Content Gap Analyzer" that researches competitor content and identifies opportunities where I can create better, more comprehensive content.

## Skill Purpose
Analyze 3-5 competitors' content strategies to identify:
- Topics they're ranking for that I'm not
- Content gaps where no one is serving the audience well
- Opportunities to create definitive, superior content
- Keywords and queries I should target
- Content formats that are underutilized in my space

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when I need to:
- Build a content strategy for a new niche or market
- Find quick-win content opportunities
- Understand what's working for competitors
- Identify topics where I can differentiate
- Plan a content roadmap for the next quarter

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:
1. [My website/business] - URL or description of what I do
2. [Competitor URLs] - 3-5 competitor websites to analyze
3. [Content goals] - traffic, leads, authority, sales
4. [Content types I can create] - blog, video, podcast, tools, templates, courses
5. [Resources available] - team size, budget, time constraints

## Analysis Process
For each competitor, research and identify:

1. **Top-performing content**
   - Most-trafficked pages
   - Most-shared content

   - Update frequency

3. **Topics and themes**
   - Main content pillars
   - Keyword clusters they target
   - Audience pain points they address

4. **Gaps and weaknesses**
   - Thin or outdated content
   - Topics they mention but don't fully cover
   - Questions they don't answer
   - Content formats they ignore

## Output Format

- Identify not just what competitors do, but what the audience needs that no one provides
- Consider content opportunities at different funnel stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Note seasonal or timely content opportunities

Create this skill so I can find and dominate content opportunities my competitors are missing.
