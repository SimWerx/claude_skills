Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Brand Voice Guide Generator" that builds a detailed brand voice and style guide to ensure consistent messaging across all marketing.

## Skill Purpose
Generate a complete brand voice guide that defines tone, language, messaging frameworks, and real examples so anyone on the team can write in the brand's voice.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke when I need to:
- Establish brand voice for a new company or rebrand
- Onboard new team members or agencies
- Ensure consistency across channels
- Evolve or refine existing brand voice
- Create content guidelines for AI tools or freelancers

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:
1. [Company/brand description] - what the business does
2. [Target audience] - who we're speaking to
3. [Brand personality traits] - 3-5 adjectives (e.g., bold, approachable, authoritative, playful)
4. [Competitive positioning] - how we're different from competitors
5. [Existing content samples] - URLs or copy I like
6. [Content we dislike] - what to avoid
7. [Core values or mission] - what the brand stands for

## Brand Voice Guide Structure
Create a guide with these sections:

### 1. Brand Voice Overview
- One-sentence brand voice summary
- Personality traits with definitions
- Voice vs. tone explanation (voice stays consistent, tone adapts to context)

### 2. Voice Spectrum
Define the brand on these spectrums (and explain why):
- Formal ←→ Casual
- Serious ←→ Playful
- Authoritative ←→ Collaborative
- Technical ←→ Simple
- Traditional ←→ Innovative

### 3. Language Guidelines
- Words and phrases we DO use
- Words and phrases we AVOID
- Industry jargon: when to use vs. simplify
- Sentence structure preferences
- Punctuation style

### 4. Messaging Framework
- Core value proposition (1-2 sentences)
- Key brand messages (3-5 pillars)
- Proof points for each pillar
- Tagline or positioning statement

### 5. Tone Variations by Channel
Define tone for:
- Website copy
- Social media (by platform if needed)
- Email marketing
- Customer support
- Sales materials
- Technical documentation

### 6. Writing Examples
For each channel, provide:
- ✅ Good example (written in brand voice)
- ❌ Bad example (what not to do)
- Explanation of why

### 7. Common Scenarios
Show how to write in brand voice for:
- Announcing good news
- Addressing a mistake or problem
- Explaining something complex
- Asking for action
- Celebrating a customer win

## Output Format
Generate a complete brand voice guide in markdown format with:
- Clear section headers
- Real, usable examples throughout
- Visual elements suggested (voice spectrum charts, dos/don'ts tables)
- Quick-reference summary at the end
- Downloadable/shareable format

## Additional Guidelines
- Make it actionable (not abstract)
- Include enough examples that someone unfamiliar with the brand can write confidently
- Build in flexibility for different contexts
- Ensure the voice feels authentic and sustainable (not forced)
- Test examples against real use cases

Create this skill so I can generate brand voice guides that actually get used.
