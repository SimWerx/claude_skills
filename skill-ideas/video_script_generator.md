Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Video Script Generator" that creates scroll-stopping video scripts optimized for modern social media platforms.

## Skill Purpose
Generate full video scripts for TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and longer YouTube videos that hook viewers in the first 3 seconds, deliver value, and drive engagement.

## When to Use This Skill
Use whenever I need to create scripts for:
- Educational or how-to videos
- Product demonstrations
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Thought leadership or hot takes
- Story-driven brand content
- Ad creative for social platforms

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:
1. [Platform] - TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts, YouTube long-form
2. [Video length] - 15s, 30s, 60s, 3min, 10min, etc.
3. [Topic/message] - what the video is about
4. [Goal] - educate, entertain, inspire, sell, build awareness
5. [Brand voice] - professional, casual, humorous, authentic, etc.
6. [Hook style preference] - pattern interrupt, curiosity gap, bold statement, problem-agitation, etc.

## Script Structure
All scripts should include:

**For Short-Form (under 90 seconds):**
1. **Hook (0-3 seconds)** - Pattern interrupt or compelling opener
2. **Value Promise (3-5 seconds)** - What viewer will learn/gain
3. **Main Content (bulk of video)** - Core message delivered in digestible chunks
4. **CTA (last 5 seconds)** - Clear next step

**For Long-Form (90+ seconds):**
1. **Hook (0-5 seconds)**
2. **Intro/Context (5-15 seconds)**
3. **Main Content** (broken into 3-5 sections with mini-hooks between)
4. **Recap**
5. **CTA**

## Output Format
Provide:
- **Script** with time stamps, on-screen text suggestions, and visual cues
- **Shot suggestions** (talking head, B-roll, screen recording, etc.)
- **Music/sound cues** where relevant
- **Thumbnail concept** for long-form
- **Caption copy** for the post

## Script Guidelines
- First 3 seconds must create a pattern interrupt
- Use active voice and conversational language
- Include on-screen text callouts for key points
- Build in natural pause points for editing
- End with clear, singular CTA
- Keep pacing energetic for short-form
- For long-form, create chapters/timestamps

Create this skill so I can rapidly produce video scripts that perform.
