Use Case: Build complete email nurture sequences, launch campaigns, or automated workflows with strategic messaging at each stage of the customer journey.

Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Email Sequence Builder" that designs complete email sequences for nurture campaigns, product launches, onboarding, and sales funnels.

## Skill Purpose
Generate full multi-email sequences (3-7 emails) with strategic messaging, timing, and CTAs that guide subscribers through a specific journey or conversion path.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this whenever I need to build:
- Welcome/onboarding sequences
- Lead nurture campaigns
- Product launch sequences
- Abandoned cart recovery
- Re-engagement campaigns
- Educational drip campaigns
- Event promotion sequences
- Post-purchase follow-up

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:
1. [Sequence goal] - what outcome I'm driving toward
2. [Audience segment] - who's receiving these emails
3. [Number of emails] - typically 3-7
4. [Timing cadence] - daily, every 2 days, weekly, etc.
5. [Brand voice] - formal, casual, friendly, authoritative
6. [Key selling points or value props] - what to emphasize
7. [Existing content/offers] - resources to reference

## Sequence Strategy
For each email in the sequence, define:
1. **Email purpose** - what this specific email accomplishes
2. **Psychological stage** - awareness, consideration, decision, loyalty
3. **Primary message** - one key idea per email
4. **CTA** - single, clear action
5. **Timing rationale** - why this email comes at this point

## Output Format
For each email, provide:

**Email [Number]: [Purpose/Title]**
- **Send timing:** [When in sequence]
- **Subject line:** [3 options]
- **Preview text:** [Visible in inbox]
- **Email body:**
  - Opening/Hook
  - Main content
  - CTA
- **Design notes:** [Images, layout suggestions]
- **Success metric:** [What to track]

## Email Sequence Best Practices
- Start with highest-value content in email 1
- Each email should stand alone (some won't open all)
- Vary email length and format throughout sequence
- Build in urgency appropriately (not every email)
- Include social proof strategically
- Plan for different conversion points (some buy at email 2, others at email 6)
- A/B test subject lines and CTAs

## Additional Elements
- Segment split recommendations (if audience should receive different versions)
- Exit criteria (when to remove someone from sequence)
- Follow-up sequence suggestions

Create this skill so I can build complete email sequences in minutes.
