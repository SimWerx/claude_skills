Prompt:

Help me create a Skill called "Social Media Content Calendar" that builds a strategic month-long content calendar with platform-specific posts optimized for 2025 algorithms.

## Skill Purpose
Generate a complete 30-day social media content calendar with daily post ideas, captions, hashtags, and timing recommendations for LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), and/or Facebook.

## When to Use This Skill
Use whenever I need to:
- Plan a month of social content in advance
- Ensure consistent posting across platforms
- Balance content types (educational, promotional, entertaining, behind-the-scenes)
- Align social content with campaigns or launches
- Maintain brand voice across channels

## Required Inputs
Ask me for:
1. [Platforms] - which social channels to plan for
2. [Posting frequency] - how many posts per day/week per platform
3. [Business/brand info] - what I do, who I serve, key offerings
4. [Content pillars] - 3-5 themes to rotate through
5. [Campaigns/launches] - any specific dates or promotions to build around
6. [Brand voice] - tone and style preferences
7. [Goals] - awareness, engagement, traffic, leads, sales

## Content Mix Strategy
Ensure calendar includes:
- 40% Educational (how-tos, tips, insights)
- 30% Engagement (questions, polls, conversations)
- 20% Promotional (products, services, offers)
- 10% Personal/Behind-the-scenes (humanize brand)

Adjust ratios based on goals and industry.

## Output Format
Create a table with these columns:
| Date | Platform | Content Type | Post Concept | Caption/Copy | Hashtags | Post Time | Visual/Format | CTA | Notes |

For each post, provide:
- **Post concept** - brief description of the content idea
- **Full caption** - ready-to-copy text with hook, value, CTA
- **Hashtags** - 5-10 relevant, researched hashtags
- **Visual guidance** - what image/video to create
- **Optimal post time** - based on platform best practices
- **Engagement prompt** - question or action to drive comments

## Platform-Specific Guidance
- **LinkedIn:** Professional tone, longer-form content, thought leadership
- **Instagram:** Visual-first, Stories + Feed + Reels mix, lifestyle + brand
- **TikTok:** Authentic, entertaining, trend-aware, educational-but-fun
- **X/Twitter:** Concise, conversational, news-reactive, threaded insights
- **Facebook:** Community-building, longer captions, shareable content

## Additional Features
- Built-in content recycling (repurpose top performers)
- Cross-platform adaptation (one idea, multiple formats)
- Buffer posts for reactive/news content
- Batch creation guidance (group similar content types)

## Calendar Guidelines
- Avoid over-promotion (80/20 rule: 80% value, 20% selling)
- Include variety in format (carousel, single image, video, text-only, polls)
- Plan for trending moments, holidays, industry events
- Build in flexibility for real-time content
- Tag potential collaborations or UGC opportunities

Create this skill so I can plan strategic, engaging social content at scale.
